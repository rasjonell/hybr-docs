I'm excited to announce the first ever release of Hybr! In the past 3 months,
I've been pouring my passion into building a tool that simplifies self-hosting.

:::note

This is a pre-alpha release. I'm putting it out there early to gather feedback and prioritize
features based on what users like you are most interested in.

## Digital Independence Made Easy

Are you someone who understands the benefits of self-hosting â€“ the self-reliance and digital independence it offers?
Do you also feel overwhelmed by the complexity of manually managing all the pieces?
Then Hybr is for you. It's an opinionated platform designed to make self-hosting accessible and manageable,
so you can focus on what matters: using your services.

## Inspired by Omakub

While browsing the internet, I stumbled upon DHH's [Omakub](https://omakub.org/), and was so inspired to build something similar.
The main point of the project is to enable people that want to take control of their data and workflow.
Hybr aims to be the "Omakub" of self-hosting, allowing its users to gain digital independence in a matter of minutes.

## Key Features (so far):

*   **One-Command Deployment:** Get popular self-hosted services up and running with a single command.
*   **Web UI Management:** Monitor and control your services through a user-friendly web interface.
*   **Secure by Default:** Leverages Tailscale (WireGuard) to ensure your services are only accessible within your private network.

## Future Plans

The roadmap is long, but some key areas I'm planning to explore include:

*   Expanding the catalog of supported services, as well as adding your personal projects.
*   Improving the CLI and Web UI
*   Adding support for automatic updates and backups.

## Try it out? ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ

Hybr is still in its early stages, and your feedback is crucial.
Download it, play around with it, and let me know what you think!

Run this single command: `curl -sSL https://hybr.dev/install.sh | bash` on your VPS(or a Raspberry Pi or an old toaster) or [check out the getting started docs](https://hybr.dev/docs/intro)

What features would make Hybr indispensable to you? What services are you most interested in seeing supported?

I'm eager to build Hybr into the best self-hosting platform, and I can't do it without your help.

Thanks for checking it out!
