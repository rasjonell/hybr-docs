In the past 3 months,\\nI\'ve been pouring my passion into building a tool that simplifies self-hosting.\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nThis is a pre-alpha release. I\'m putting it out there early to gather feedback and prioritize\\nfeatures based on what users like you are most interested in.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Digital Independence Made Easy\\n\\nAre you someone who understands the benefits of self-hosting \u2013 the self-reliance and digital independence it offers?\\nDo you also feel overwhelmed by the complexity of manually managing all the pieces?\\nThen Hybr is for you. It\'s an opinionated platform designed to make self-hosting accessible and manageable,\\nso you can focus on what matters: using your services.\\n\\n## Inspired by Omakub\\n\\nWhile browsing the internet, I stumbled upon DHH\'s [Omakub](https://omakub.org/), and was so inspired to build something similar.\\nThe main point of the project is to enable people that want to take control of their data and workflow.\\nHybr aims to be the \\"Omakub\\" of self-hosting, allowing its users to gain digital independence in a matter of minutes.\\n\\n## Key Features (so far):\\n\\n*   **One-Command Deployment:** Get popular self-hosted services up and running with a single command.\\n*   **Web UI Management:** Monitor and control your services through a user-friendly web interface.\\n*   **Secure by Default:** Leverages Tailscale (WireGuard) to ensure your services are only accessible within your private network.\\n\\n## Future Plans\\n\\nThe roadmap is long, but some key areas I\'m planning to explore include:\\n\\n*   Expanding the catalog of supported services, as well as adding your personal projects.\\n*   Improving the CLI and Web UI\\n*   Adding support for automatic updates and backups.\\n\\n## Try it out? \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48\\n\\nHybr is still in its early stages, and your feedback is crucial.\\nDownload it, play around with it, and let me know what you think!\\n\\nRun this single command: `curl -sSL https://hybr.dev/install.sh | bash` on your VPS(or a Raspberry Pi or an old toaster) or [check out the getting started docs](https://hybr.dev/docs/intro)\\n\\nWhat features would make Hybr indispensable to you? What services are you most interested in seeing supported?\\n\\nI\'m eager to build Hybr into the best self-hosting platform, and I can\'t do it without your help.\\n\\nThanks for checking it out!"}]}}')}}]);
